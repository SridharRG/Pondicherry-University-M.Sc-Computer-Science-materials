### WSMA 413 - Rethinking Feminism from Indian Perspective

This Rethinking Feminism softcore from women studies was a eyeopening for my left idealogy which helped me for many learning and unlearning and explores the evolution of feminist thought, challenging traditional narratives and examining intersections of gender with race, class, and culture. It engaged me into critical thinking about power dynamics, representation, and inclusivity, while emphasizing the role of activism and systemic change in shaping equitable societies.
